Step 1: Project Setup:

Set up your React project using Create React App or any 
other preferred method. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

Step 2: Component Structure:

Plan the component structure for the "Place Order" screen.
Create a new directory named PlaceOrder inside your src folder.
Inside the PlaceOrder directory, create the following components:

Step 3: Implement ShowItems Component:

In the ShowItems component, fetch the list of items available
for purchase from an API or use static data. Display the items
with their names, prices, and an input field for the quantity.
Allow users to adjust the quantity they want to order.

Step 4: Implement Payments Component:

In the Payments component, create a form with options for
various payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, etc.).
Let users select their preferred payment method.

Step 5: Implement Address Component:

In the Address component, create a form to collect the user's
shipping address details, such as name, address line 1, 
address line 2, city, state/province, postal code, and country.

Step 6: Implement PlaceOrderAction Component:

The PlaceOrderAction component will handle the final step of
the order placement process. It should receive the selected items,
payment method, and shipping address as props from its parent component.
Inside this component, you can implement the logic to validate the
user inputs and call the API to place the order.

Step 7: Implement SubmitButton Component:

Create a reusable SubmitButton component that will be used in various
places across the "Place Order" screen. You can pass the button text
and a callback function as props to this component.

Step 8: Handle State Management:

Use React's state or a state management library like Redux to manage
the state of the "Place Order" screen. Lift the state up to the
parent component that contains ShowItems, Payments, and Address.

Step 9: Connect Components:

Inside the parent component, render the ShowItems, Payments,
and Address components along with the SubmitButton. Pass the necessary
data and callback functions as props to each child component.

Step 10: Finalize the "Place Order" Flow:

When the user selects items, payment method, and enters the
shipping address, enable the "Submit" button. When the user
clicks the "Submit" button, trigger the PlaceOrderAction
component to place the order.

Step 11: Testing:

Test the "Place Order" screen thoroughly to ensure that all
components and functionalities are working as expected.
Verify the data sent to the server and the response received.
